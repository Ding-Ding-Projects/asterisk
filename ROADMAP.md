# Ding PBX delivery roadmap

## Delivery foundation

- [x] Add a pinned, digest-verified, user-scoped Windows dependency bootstrap.
- [x] Add touchless and interactive root build entry points.
- [x] Add unsigned Squirrel.Windows package verification for `Setup.exe`, `RELEASES`, and full packages.
- [x] Replace inherited test and administration workflows with separate build/package/release and Pages publication workflows.
- [x] Add unique release tags, workflow timing, SHA-256 records, safe failure artifacts, and runner fallback.
- [x] Add a reproducible committed line counter with project, generated, and inherited-source attribution.

## Design parity

- [x] Compile the checked-in design reference into the renderer instead of hand-writing an approximation of it.
- [x] Guard the compiled output against drift with a byte-identical recompile check.
- [x] Reproduce every audited declarative binding in the compiled renderer.
- [x] Bundle the design's type and icon families locally so the renderer fetches nothing at runtime.
- [x] Derive the navigation catalogue, the documentation set, and the static site catalogue from the design rather than from three divergent hand-written lists.
- [ ] Add reference-versus-built captures and visual diffs, so destinations can move from `compiled` to `verified`.

## Real readings, no sample data

- [x] Read live channels, endpoints, contacts, registrations, queues, modules and uptime from allowlisted read-only Asterisk CLI commands.
- [x] Draw the dialplan canvas from the target's own `dialplan show` output.
- [x] Remove the design's sample rows, dashboard tiles, health bars, nav badges, history, agent-rail and trunk-authentication content from the running app.
- [x] State the exact reason a surface is empty instead of showing an invented value.
- [ ] Read per-endpoint transport and codecs, so those columns stop reading `—`.
- [ ] Wire real sources for the history, agent and trunk-authentication surfaces.
- [ ] Verify every reading against a live Asterisk target.

## Evidence and completeness

- [x] Record the independent design audit's source hash and exact aggregate counts.
- [x] Add fail-closed schema and completeness validators.
- [x] Add deliberate red-then-green negative regression scripts.
- [ ] Map all 32 audited destinations to final reference routes, product routes, and built-artifact captures after integration.
- [ ] Replace every unverified per-surface inventory field with merged implementation, documentation, localization, local-check, interaction, and capture evidence.
- [x] Run the built Windows console through the approved headless interaction route and record genuine packaged interaction evidence for WSL discovery.

## Release readiness

- [x] Verify `download-dependencies.bat /s` from a clean user-scoped toolchain cache.
- [x] Verify `build.bat /s` at the merged candidate commit.
- [x] Verify `build-installer.bat /s` produces an unsigned installable Squirrel.Windows set.
- [x] Bundle a complete Ubuntu WSL root filesystem containing Asterisk and every runtime dependency inside the installer.
- [x] Verify the static Pages output includes `console/site/dist/build-manifest.json` and deploys without runtime asset fetches.
- [x] Rework the static Pages home into a modern responsive marketing and documentation surface while preserving all 32 destination identifiers and honest release availability.
- [x] Split the static experience into compact Home, Product, Documentation, Downloads, Status, and Settings routes with shared local assets and anchored article navigation.
- [ ] Publish and independently verify the first unique non-draft Ding PBX Console release and downloadable assets.
